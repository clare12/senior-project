README

Using limejs as submodule in lib/limejs.
Also using google's closure library in lib/closure.
To set up: after limejs has been cloned, run "bin/lime.py init" to download closure libraries.
When adding files: everytime adding goog.provide or goog.require, run "bin/lime.py update" to update the dependencies.
